# Project Overview

## **EchoEyes: Transforming Education for Visually Impaired Students**

An innovative AI-powered platform revolutionizing accessibility in education for visually impaired and partially blind students, creating equal opportunities for learning and academic success.

### **Mission:**

EchoEyes is dedicated to empowering visually impaired and partially blind students by harnessing advanced technology to bridge gaps in accessibility and inclusivity. Our mission is to provide transformative educational tools that enable these learners to thrive academically, socially, and professionally

### **Background:**

Education is a fundamental right, yet visually impaired students in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa face numerous barriers:

- Limited access to accessible educational materials.
- Scarcity of assistive technologies for effective learning.
- Challenges in engaging with STEM fields due to non-visual formats of content delivery.

EchoEyes addresses these challenges by offering tailored solutions designed to meet the unique learning needs of visually impaired students, ensuring they are not left behind in the educational journey.

### **Solution Description:**

**EchoEyes** integrates state-of-the-art technologies, including Generative AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision, to develop an adaptive learning platform tailored specifically for visually impaired students. The platform is designed to be intuitive, inclusive, and scalable, fostering an environment where students can learn effectively despite visual limitations.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Adaptive Text-to-Speech (TTS):**  
   Multilingual support in **Urdu, Pashto, and English**, enabling auditory access to educational content and enhancing comprehension.

2. **Personalized Learning Pathways:**  
   AI-driven customization of lesson plans to align with individual learning styles and abilities, ensuring effective and personalized education.

3. **Interactive Braille Modules:**  
   Dynamic Braille Displays and haptic feedback systems make tactile learning experiences seamless and intuitive, particularly for STEM subjects.

4. **Real-Time Object Recognition and AI-Based Audio Descriptions:**  
   Enhances classroom navigation and understanding of visual content, providing students with immediate, AI-generated auditory descriptions of their environment.

5. **Tactile STEM Tools:**  
   3D-printed materials allow for hands-on engagement in science, technology, engineering, and math, bringing abstract concepts to life through touch.

6. **Offline Functionality:**  
   Ensures uninterrupted access to learning resources in low-connectivity or remote areas, making the platform viable for underserved regions.

### **Impact:**

Pilot testing conducted in local institutes demonstrated the profound potential of EchoEyes:

- **Enhanced Engagement:** Students displayed a noticeable increase in active participation during lessons.
- **Improved Academic Performance:** A significant rise in test scores and concept retention was observed.
- **Positive Feedback:** Educators and students praised the tactile and audio-guided tools, emphasizing their effectiveness in making learning accessible and engaging.

By addressing critical accessibility gaps, EchoEyes aims to transform the educational landscape for visually impaired students, setting a benchmark for inclusive learning systems in the region.

### **Funding Request:**

To scale EchoEyes and maximize its impact, we are seeking **$100,000** through the UNICEF grant. The funding will be allocated as follows:

- Further development of AI-powered modules and accessibility tools.
- Implementation in additional educational institutes across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
- Ongoing support and training for educators and students to ensure seamless integration of the platform.
